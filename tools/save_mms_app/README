Save MMS Application
====================

What it is?
===========

It is a http server/application which listens for MBuni requests (MMS) on a configurable port. 
When it receives a request, it saves the attachments of the MMS message to a specified directory.

Configuration:
==============

Find the config.yaml in the config/ directory. Only the port and the directory to save attachments to are 
configurable at this point.

Installling:
============

Just copy the files. You are going to need to have Ruby and (optionally) the rake gem installed. 
Also, you need the library files which are located in the mmslib directory. Simply copy this directory
to somewhere on your system and 

export RUBYLIB=/path/to/mmslib 

before running the save mms application.

Running:
========

In the top directory type
$ ruby script/server 

or simple run rake, which will do the same.

MBuni
=====

You need to setup an MBuni service that uses the save mms app. Here is an example:

group = mms-service
name = default
post-url = http://localhost:3111/savemms
http-post-parameters = keyword=%k&images=%i&video=%v&text=%t&audio=%a&binary=%b&other=%o
catch-all = true
keyword = test
omit-empty = no
service-code = regular
suppress-reply = true

Note, that the savemms app uses those particular cgi parameters, if other names are used, attachments
will not be saved correctly.
