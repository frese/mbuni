This is a set of Ruby scripts that allows sending messages through MBuine
sendmms interface. The two central scripts are:

- sendmms_binary.rb: Sends a binary message in eaif format through MBuine
- sendmms_mime.rb: Sends a message in MIME format through MBuni. 

Requires the presensence of mmslib. An easy way to temporarely add this 
is to:
export RUBYLIB=/path/to/mmslib

Recent changes:

The new scripts uses a simpler DSL language for sending messages.
I got tired of commenting out lines and having separate tunnels 
configured for each mbuni connection.
