Scripts to generate webalizer pages from kannel access.log format.

* smsc-id name have only one slash in it
example: KannelClient-P12345
First field is client name and second field is short number, "P"
for production SMSC

* sendsms-user and service name have at least two slashes in it
example: KannelClient-MT-Logos or KannelClient-MO-ReplyLogo
First field is client name, second is MT for sendsms-users 
(web generated MT messages) and MO for services (even if it is
a MT message, it's a reply to an MO). Could be something like
USER and SERVICE. Third field is the service name.

* scripts have some hard-coded directories and filenames.
I have a user kannel, in directory /home/kannel, inside a
bin, etc and var/log. Just check and adjust them.

* stats.sh could be run in crontab when everything is working
ok

* scripts uses <ClientName> to create a directory and 
the rest for the webalizer directory. This way, we could have
different directories for different clients connected to kannel
