2001-02-01  Richard Braakman  <dark@wapit.com>

	* Making release 1.1.1.

2001-02-01  Uoti Urpala  <uau@wapit.com>

	* gw/urltrans.c: Bugfix, find_default_translation() now returns
	NULL if no default was given.

2001-02-01  Richard Braakman  <dark@wapit.com>

	* gw/smsbox.c: cleanup.  send_message does not destroy its msg
	anymore, leaves that to caller (fixes memory leaks). 
	obey_request always destroys the pattern it creates.
	obey_request_thread actually sends "Requests failed" messages
	and is simplified a little.

2001-02-01  Richard Braakman  <dark@wapit.com>

	* gw/smsc_cimd2.c: Update to version 2-0 en.
	Added definitions for new parameter numbers 26, 28, 44, and 62.
	Corrected range of "status report request" parameter from 0..32
	to 0..63.

2001-01-31  Uoti Urpala  <uau@wapit.com>

	* gw/wap-appl.c: Fixed an uninitialized variable.

	* test/test_http_server.c: Fixed double octstr_destroy().

2001-01-31  Richard Braakman  <dark@wapit.com>

	* gwlib/octstr.c: Made octstr_destroy() call seems_valid even
	if the octstr is immutable.  This should catch double destroy
	calls in the future.

	* gwlib/gwthread-pthread.c: In gwthread_wakeup() and gwthread_join(),
	assert that the thread number >= 0.

2001-01-31  Uoti Urpala  <uau@wapit.com>

	* gw/bb_udp.c, gw/wap_push_ota.c: Fixed double octstr_destroy() calls.

2001-01-31  Uoti Urpala  <uau@wapit.com>

	* gwlib/http.c: Don't try to wake up the server thread at shutdown
	if it was never created.

2001-01-31  Peter Grönholm  <peter@wapit.com>

	* doc/userguide/userguide.xml: Wrote section 'Using pre-compiled
	binary packages'.

2001-01-31  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

	* gwlib/utils.c: Rewrote the is_allowed_ip implementation to
	use Octstr instead of C strings. Removed the now-unused check_ip
	function.

	* checks/check_ipcheck.c: Wrote.

2001-01-30  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

	* gwlib/utils.[ch]: Made is_allowed_ip accept Octstr arguments
	instead of char *. Dies, cstr, die.
	
	* gw/bb_boxc.c, gw/bb_http.c, gw/bb_udp.c, gw/smsbox.c,
	gw/smsc_emi.c, gw/smsc_fake.c: Fixed the calls to is_allowed_ip
	to follow new calling convention.

2001-01-30  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

	* Makefile.in: Moved the wildcard patterns to the beginning, where
	they are more visible. Should've done this when I first wrote them.
	
	* gw/smsbox.c: Fix memory leak.
	
	* gw/smsc_fake.c: don't call octstr_get_cstr with NULL argument.
	(Should fix is_allowed_ip instead.)
	
	* gw/urltrans.c: Look up the keyword in a case insensitive manner.
	Thanks to Peter for pointing this out.
	
	* gwlib/gwmem.h: Introduced the gw_claim_area_for macro. It is the
	same as gw_claim_area, except it gets the position as arguments,
	instead of figuring it out itself.

	* gwlib/cfg.[ch]: Used gw_claim_area_for to claim the return
	value of cfg_get.

2001-01-29  Richard Braakman  <dark@wapit.com>

	* gwlib/dict.c: Make dict_keys() lock its dictionary.

2001-01-29  Kalle Marjola  <rpr@wapit.com>

	* Makefile.in: clean now deletes */*.o, too. 

2001-01-29  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

	* gwlib/protected.h: Undefine the protection macros before
	defining them, to avoid problems with multiple definitions on
	platforms that define them as macros instead of (or in addition
	to) functions.

2001-01-26  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

	* gwlib/octstr.[ch], gw/smsbox.c: Killed the almost-unused
	function octstr_replace and converted the only place it was
	being used anymore to create a new Octstr instead.

2001-01-26  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

	* AUTHORS, ChangeLog, NEWS, checks/check_fakesmsc.sh,
	checks/check_fakewap.sh, checks/check_sendsms.sh,
	checks/check_smpp.sh, doc/arch/arch.xml, gw/bb_smscconn.c,
	gw/bearerbox,.c gw/smsbox.c, gw/smsc.c gw/urltrans.[ch],
	gw/wapbox.c, gwlib/http.c, gwlib/octstr. test/drive_smpp.c,
	test/test_http.c, test/test_octstr_format.c: Edited some long
	lines to be shorter than 80 characters. There's still lots
	more, find them with utils/find-long-lines.

2001-01-26  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

	* gw/alt_charsets.h, gw/bb.h, gwlib/accesslog.h, gwlib/gwlib.h,
	gwlib/gwmem.h, gwlib/socket.h, gwlib/utils.h, test/decompile.h,
	utils/OTAbitmap.h, utils/wbmp.h: Removed leading underscore from
	symbols. It is reserved to the C implementation and is not to
	be used by application code.
	
	* gwlib/socket.[ch]: Removed unused functions socket_query_blocking,
	read_line, and read_to_eof.
	
	* gwlib/utils.[ch]: Removed unused function print_std_args_usage.
	
	* gwlib/gw_inet.[ch], gw/wap_push_ota.c: Removed the (unused)
	gw_inet_ntop wrapper.

2001-01-26  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

	* doc/userguide/userguide.xml: Documented the "phone" option in
	EMI over modem.

2001-01-26  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

	* The standard library function inet_ntoa is not thread safe.
	Instead of writing a wrapper, I decided it's better to convert
	to using the gw_netaddr_to_octstr implementation Derek Hamilton
	wrote for us.
	
    	* gwlib/protected.h: Added a macro to trap inet_ntoa calls.
	
	* gw/smsc_ois.c, gwlib/socket.c, test/test_cimd2.c: Converted
	use of inet_ntoa to gw_netaddr_to_octstr.
	
	* gwlib/socket.[ch]: Removed the unused function
	socket_get_peer_ip and slighly change the use of whitespace in
	the gw_netaddr_to_octstr to follow project coding style.

2001-01-26  Uoti Urpala  <uau@wapit.com>

	* gw/urltrans.c: Converted to use octstr_create_urlcoded instead
	of file-specific function.

2001-01-25  Uoti Urpala  <uau@wapit.com>

	* gw/smsc.c, gw/smsc_p.h, gw/smsc_fake.c, gw/smsc_fake2.c,
	gw/smscconn.c, gw/smscconn_p.h, test/fakesmsc.c, test/fakesmsc2.c:
	Removed the old fakesmsc and replaced it with the new one.
	Note that the new version is used differently from the old one!

	* gw/smskannel.conf, checks/check_fakesmsc.sh,
	checks/check_sendsms.sh: Changed the examples and checks to use
	new fakesmsc.

	* doc/userguide/userguide.xml: Changed the documentation to
	describe the new fakesmsc.

	* gw/smsc_cimd.c: Fixed a possible NULL reference.

	* gw/smsc_cimd2.c: Added a missing #include <string.h>.

2001-01-25  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

    	* gw/bb_udp.c, gwlib/cfg.def: Applied and adapted patch from
	Laurent Foulonneau to implement UDP packet filtering based on
	sender IP number.

	* doc/userguide/userguide.xml: Documented the new options.

2001-01-25  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

	* gw/smsc.c, gw/smsc_at.c, gw/smsc_p.h, gwlib/cfg.def: Applied
	and slightly adapted patch from Bjarne Saltbæk for implementing
	a validity period option for the GSM phone driver.

	* doc/userguide/userguide.xml: Documented the new option.

2001-01-24  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

	* doc/arch/arch.xml: Added missing </sect1>.
	
	* gwlib/http.c: Added creation of http exceptions list.

2001-01-24  Uoti Urpala  <uau@wapit.com>

	* gw/smsbox.c, gw/smsc.c, gw/smsc_p.h: Fixed memory leaks.

2001-01-24  Uoti Urpala  <uau@wapit.com>

	* gw/smscconn.c, gw/bb_smscconn.c: Fixed memory leaks

2001-01-24  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

	* gw/bb_boxc.c, gw/bb_http.c, gw/bb_udp.c, gw/bearerbox.[ch]:
	Killed memory leaks due to unfreed configuration data.

2001-01-24  Uoti Urpala <uau@wapit.com>

	* test/fakesmsc2.c, gw/smsc_fake2.c: Several fake2 changes, added
	send/receive udh, possibility to restrict connections based on IP.
	Messages on command line need to be written differently.

	* gwlib/octstr.[ch]: Added octstr_create_urlcoded() function.

2001-01-23  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

	* Ran some compiles with stricter warning options than -Wall.
	This resulted in a few minor changes.
	
	* gw/bb_smscconn.c: Removed the function smsc2_addwdp, since it is
	unused and the wapbox is the better place to do WAP-on-SMS anyway.
	
	* gw/smpp_pdu.c: Cast the return value of octstr_len in an assert
	that compares it to an unsigned long. This is a bit ugly, but -
	in my humble opinion - better than a warning about comparing signed
	and unsigned. Reasonable minds differ.
	
	* gwlib/gwthread.h: Removed duplicate prototype for
	gwthread_dumpsigmask.
	
	* gwlib/socket.c: Made gw_netaddr_to_octstr4 and
	gw_netaddr_to_octstr6 static, since they're not to be used from
	outside socket.c.
	
	* test/decompile.c: Made a number of functions static. I don't
	understand why some functions are declared in decompile.h (or
	why decompile.h exists in the first place), but presumably there
	is a good reason for this. Removed the Read_zero_index function,
	since it was unused.
	
	* test/test_cimd2.c, test/test_headers.c, test/test_pdu.c,
	test/test_wakeup.c, test/udpfeed.c, utils/seewbmp.c: Use a return
	statement instead of calling exit. Stylistic change.
	
	* utils/run_kannel_box.c: Make main_loop return instead of
	calling exit directly. Stylistic change.

2001-01-23  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

	* doc/arch/arch.xml: Fixed references to figures.

2001-01-23  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

	* gw/bb_boxc.c, gw/bb_smscconn.c, gw/bb_udp.c, gw/bearerbox.[ch],
	gw/smsc.[ch], gw/smsc_emi.c, gw/smsc_fake2.c, gw/smsc_p.h,
	gw/smsc_wrapper.c, gw/smscconn.[ch], gw/smscconn_p.h: Converted
	the bearerbox to use the new configuration file interface. This
	resulted in large, but simple changes in many files.

	* gwlib/cfg.def: Added variable 'phone' to an smsc group. Not
	documented anywhere, it seems.
	
	* gwlib/gwlib.h, gwlib/conffile.[ch]: Removed the old
	configuration file interface.

2001-01-23  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

	* gwlib/cfg.c: Implemented a check that makes sure a CfgGroup is
	only queried for variables that it can legally contain. This 
	showed some bugs, which have been corrected by the changes below.
	
	* gwlib/cfg.[ch]: Wrote function cfg_get_group_name, needed by
	urltrans.c changes.
	
	* gw/urltrans.c: Fixed the code so it doesn't try to get the value
	of every variable from every group. The resulting code should be
	somewhat cleaner and easier to follow, as well.
	
	* gw/wapbox.c: Don't query the variable "heartbeat-freq",
	because it isn't documented anywhere, no other box uses it,
	and there is no need to make the value configurable.

2001-01-23  Kalle Marjola  <rpr@wapit.com>

	* gw/bearerbox.c: switched smsbox/smsc startup to avoid hangup
	with bad luck
