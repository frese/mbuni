2001-03-20  Richard Braakman  <dark@wapit.com>

	* Making release 1.1.3.

2001-03-19  Tuomas Luttinen  <tuo@wapit.com>

	* gw/wml_compiler.c: Fixed a warning.

	* checks/check_compiler.sh: A simple script added that takes a WML 
	source, runs it through the WML compiler and the decompiler and 
	diffes the original file to the output and reports an error if 
	they do differ.

	* test/testcase.wml: A testcase for the check_compiler added.

2001-03-19  Uoti Urpala  <uau@wapit.com>

	* gw/smsc_http.c: Shutdown state was not initialized. Fixed.

2001-03-19  Richard Braakman  <dark@wapit.com>

	* gwlib/http.c: Made parse_http_version() thread-safe.  (There is
	no guarantee that assignment of pointers or longs is atomic.)

2001-03-19  Kalle Marjola  <rpr@wapit.com>

	* gw/bearerbox.c: commented gwthread_join_all() away and now all
	checks pass. Have to investigate this more...

2001-03-19  Richard Braakman  <dark@wapit.com>

	* wap/wsp_session.c: Fix TR_Invoke_Cnf case in find_session_machine(),
	spotted by zig cats.

2001-03-19  Kalle Marjola  <rpr@wapit.com>

	* doc/userguide/userguide.xml: added HTTP SMSC chapter

	* gw/smskannel.conf: added sms-service and send-sms for relay use

	* gw/other_smskannel.conf: Added. For client Kannel in Kannel
	relay tests

	* gw/smsc_http.c: little bugfizes/updates

	* checks/check_httpsmsc_kannel.sh. Added. Note that currently
	there is a BUG in gwlib/http.c and/or gw/smsc_http.c and this
	tests always FAILS as client bearerbox (using other_smskannel.conf)
	never exits (HTTP client side thread does not die?)
	
2001-03-19  Kalle Marjola  <rpr@wapit.com>

	* gw/http.c: Bugfix. Make shutdown work for multiple servers

2001-03-19  Kalle Marjola  <rpr@wapit.com>

	* gw/smsc_http.c: Added. New module to handle HTTP based SMS
	Center connections or other gateways (relay gateways). Currently
	only supports 'kannel' as relay gateway

	* gw/smscconn.c, gw/smscconn_p.h: modified to understand new
	SMSCConn type

	* gwlib/cfg.def: accept new configuration variable 'send-url' used
	with smsc_http

2001-03-19  Kalle Marjola  <rpr@wapit.com>

	* gwlib/utils.c|h: added new function connect_denied(..), which is
	like the old is_allowed_ip(..) except that deny-ip is no longer
	used as it is expected to be "*.*.*.*" and no allow-ip means
	localhost. This function will hopefully eventually replace all old
	ip-checkings, to tighten basic security

2001-03-19  Kalle Marjola  <rpr@wapit.com>

	* gw/bb_smscconn.c (sms_router): Bugfix. Now hopefully router does
	not get stuck again if the list is successfully emptied

2001-03-16  Kalle Marjola  <rpr@wapit.com>

	* gwlib/http.c: Bugfix: wakeup server when new port added, so that
	it is added to select

2001-03-16  Tuomas Luttinen  <tuo@wapit.com>

	* test/decompile.c (DTDTypeList): Added the URLs for those DTDs whose 
	URL was easily located.

	* test/decompile.c (Read_termstr_rtn): Bug fix: double the dollar 
	signs, since dollar is escaped as $$ in WML.

2001-03-16 Nick Clarey  <nclarey@3glab.com>

	* gw/smsc_at.c: Repaired a bug in at_reopen which would cause 
	failed smsc_at connections to be reopened continuously, and
	repaired a bug in at_close which could possibly cause memory 
	leakage. Also fixed bugs in both which didn't reset the smsc's
	file descriptor correctly in case of failed closes.

2001-03-16  Tuomas Luttinen  <tuo@wapit.com>

	* gw/wml_definitions.h: The WBXML_CHILD_BIT was changed into 
	WBXML_CONTENT_BIT for clarity.
	
	* gw/wml_compiler.c (only_blanks): A patch provided by Bernard Valton
	that prevents white space counted as element content.
	Also changed the WBXML_CHILD_BIT into WBXML_CONTENT_BIT for clarity.

2001-03-16  Richard Braakman  <dark@wapit.com>

	* gw/wap-appl.c: Fixed memory leak of request_headers in request_data.
	Made return_result not destroy the WAP event passed to it (caller
	should do that).  Memory management in this file is still icky.

	* gw/wapbox.c: Always destroy a msg after processing it, this fixes
	a memory leak handling admin messages.

2001-03-16  Kalle Marjola  <rpr@wapit.com>

	* gwlib/octstr.h|c: added %E to octstr_format, which takes an
	Octstr and URL-encodes it into string

	* test/test_octstr_format.c: added test for that format

2001-03-16  Richard Braakman  <dark@wapit.com>

	* When logging errors, do not report errno if it's not relevant.
	Fixed 25 counts of this, leaving 81 valid uses.

	* Updated NEWS file to prepare for 1.1.3.

	* test/test_http_server.c: Run client_thread in a separate thread.
	This makes check_http.sh not fail.  (sigterm was calling
	http_close_all_ports while the main thread itself was in
	port_get_request).

2001-03-15  Uoti Urpala  <uau@wapit.com>

	* test/test_smsc.c: Fixed a memory allocation bug.

2001-03-15  Tuomas Luttinen  <tuo@wapit.com>

	* test/wml_tester.c: I refined the command line arguments a bit. Now 
	the output is either a normal dump, the dump with source or the binary 
	only. The output can be directed into a file that can then contain the
	binary only if that was the selected output.

	* test/decompile.c: Now decompiler accepts input from stdin. Added for 
	piping to make writing tests easier.

2001-03-15  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

	* Changed the HTTP server side code so that it allows easily
	processing requests to different ports in different ways.
	
	* gwlib/http.[ch]: Renamed http_open_server to http_open_port,
	and http_close_all_servers to http_close_all_ports, since the
	concept of "server" is a bit confusing when used this way. Port
	is clearer.
	
	* gwlib/http.[ch]: Added port argument to http_accept_request
	so that the caller can specify which port she's interested in.
	This then required some changes in the internals of http.c
	because the clients_with_requests list had to be replaced
	with port specific lists, and this required some inter-thread
	communication, which was a bit tricky to get working (and it
	therefore likely to be buggy in non-obvious ways). Also added new
	function, http_close_port, to allow closing only a specific port.

	* gw/bb_http.c, gw/smsbox.c, test/drive_wapbox.c,
	test/test_http_server.c, test/test_smsc.c: Changed calls to http
	code based on interface code.

2001-03-15  Uoti Urpala  <uau@wapit.com>

	* gwlib/http.c, gwlib/http.h: Changed http_start_request and
	http_receive_result to identify the request with a void pointer
	from the caller.

	* gw/smsbox.c, gw/wap-appl.c, test/test_http.c: Related changes.

2001-03-13  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

	* benchmarks/bench_sms.sh: Only plot the "submit" events; in long
	runs, the different graphs were on top of each other anyway.

2001-03-13  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

    	* Various improvements to "make bench".

	* benchmarks/bench_http.sh, benchmarks/bench_sms.sh,
	benchmarks/run-benchmarks: Implemented --fast option.
	
	* benchmarks/functions.inc: Isolated common script stuff into
	a single file to make maintenance easier and scripts clearer.
	
	* test/test_smsc.c: Measure round trip times for requests and
	replies. Started coding "sustained level" benchmark; not useable
	yet, though.

	* gwlib/http.c: Commented out unused static functions.

2001-03-12  Uoti Urpala  <uau@wapit.com>

	* gw/smsc_fake.c: Added test for errno == EINTR after
	gwthread_pollfd().

2001-03-07  Derry Hamilton <rasilon@tardis.ed.ac.uk>

	* mk-solaris-package.sh, prototype.tmpl, prototype: modified
	mk-solaris to create packages with the actual version rather
	than just assume that it is cvs.  Modified prototype to be
	prototype.tmpl and mk-solaris now uses it to generate the
	correct prototype.

2001-03-05  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

	* benchmarks/bench_http.sh: Removed unnecessary cruft. Set number
	of HTTP requests made to 100 000 instead of 1000.
	
	* benchmarks/bench_http.txt, benchmarks/bench_sms.txt,
	benchmarks/report-begin.txt: Added missing </para>.
	
	* benchmarks/bench_sms.sh: Set number of requests to 100 000
	instead of 1000.
	
	* gwlib/http.c: Disabled re-use of TCP connections for HTTP
	transactions. There is a bug somewhere that makes this crash.
	
	* test/test_http.c: Allow client to queue multiple requests into
	a queue (up to MAX_IN_QUEUE #define in test_http.c), instead of
	doing the next one only after the response to the previous one
	has finished.
	
2001-03-01  Uoti Urpala  <uau@wapit.com>

	* gw/smsbox.c: Added a temporary half-fix for a bug that could
	cause NULL references with sms-service HTTP requests. Has to be
	fixed properly later.

2001-03-01  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

	* test/test_http.c: Reformatted to follow current coding style.

2001-03-01  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

	* Implemented the beginnings of a framework for automated
	benchmarks.
	
	* Makefile.in: "make bench" now runs the automated benchmark.
    	"make clean" removes the cruft.
	
	* benchmarks/.cvsignore, benchmarks/bench_http.sh,
	benchmarks/bench_http.txt, benchmarks/bench_sms.sh,
	benchmarks/bench_sms.conf, benchmarks/bench_sms.txt,
	benchmarks/report-begin.txt, benchmarks/report-end.txt,
	benchmarks/run-benchmarks: Wrote.
	
    	* test/test_smsc.c, test/timestamp.c: Wrote.

	* test/test_http_server.c: Added option -l for setting logfile
	name.

2001-03-01  Kalle Marjola  <rpr@wapit.com>

	* gw/bb_boxc.c, gw/shared.c: Fix, modified so that error in read
	causes connection to be broken, instead of possible trap in
	infinite loop. Pointed out by Paul Keogh. 

2001-03-01  Uoti Urpala  <uau@wapit.com>

	* gwlib/http.c: Don't panic or crash if request contains spaces.

2001-02-28  Kalle Marjola  <rpr@wapit.com>

	* gw/bb_udp.c: 'bugfix': modified so that all errors just make
	receiver to continue, instead of exiting loop

2001-02-28  Richard Braakman <dark@wapit.com>

	* gw/smsc_at.c: Made pdu_extract deal with the SMSC address field
	possibly being bad or too short.  Also made hexchar() take an
	int as argument, instead of char (which might be signed).
	toupper() is defined as taking an int, anyway.

2001-02-27  Kalle Marjola  <rpr@wapit.com>

	* gw/drive_smpp.c: modified to accept Msg 'admin', too

	* gw/bb_boxc.c: unused variable removed

2001-02-27  Kalle Marjola  <rpr@wapit.com>

	* gw/bb_boxc.c: Modified to use Conn instead of raw TCP/IP with
	sms|wapbox connections

	* gw/msg[-decl].h: added new message type 'admin' for
	shutdown/suspend use.

	* gw/smsbox.c: modified to die when shutdown command
	received. Needs to implement suspend/shutdown, still

	* gw/wapbox.c: modified to die when shutdown command received and
	to ignore non-wdp messages

	* gwlib/octstr.h|c: removed now non-used octstr_send and
	octstr_recv

2001-02-27  Richard Braakman <dark@wapit.com>

	* Ran spelling check over userguide.xml.
