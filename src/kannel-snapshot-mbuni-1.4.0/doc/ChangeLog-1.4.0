    * gw/bb_smscconn.c: fixing bug #160, causing segfault on cygwin while
      using uninited rwlock functions.

2004-11-15 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * doc/examples/dlr-*.conf: fixed group name from e.g. dlr-mysql -> dlr-db.
      Thanks to James Coleman jamesc_at_doolin.com for pointing to this.

2004-11-05 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * gwlib/utils.c: fixes daemon mode (make sure stdin/stdout/sdterr are
      opened and do chdir("/")) and change user code (set supplementary group
      id's and don't destroy passwd struct).
    * doc/userguide/userguide.xml: documented the fact that daemon mode changes
      CDW to `/'.

2004-11-05 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * gwlib/protected.c: fixed linux version of gw_gethostbyname when
      gethostbyname_r failed. Also free buffer on error.
      Bug: #157.

2004-11-03 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * gwlib/dbpool_pgsql.c: fixed double free (PGFinish will destroy
      connection for us).

2004-10-31 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * gw/msg.c: fixed double free in 'msg_unpack'.

2004-10-28  Stipe Tolj  <stolj@wapme.de>
    * gwlib/utils.[ch]: source code reformating of get_and_set_debugs().
      No logic change. Added global arguments to header file.
    * test/fakesmsc.c: switching from -p to -r for port, since utils.c uses
      -p for pid-file creation. This broke current cvs to use an other port
      then the default 10000 to connect to the smsc_fake module of bearerbox.
    * doc/userguide/userguide.xml: fixing the command line arguments list
      for fakesmsc to reflect the change from -p to -r for the port.

2004-10-21 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * gw/smsc/smsc_smpp.c: fixed bug #129 (Incorrect handling of
      GSM_ADDR_TON_ALPHANUMERIC for destination address).

2004-10-13  Kalle Marjola  <kmarjola@enpocket.com>
    * test/test_ppg.c: Added support for X-WAP-Initiator-URI, use -I
      option.

2004-10-06 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * configure.in, configure: added check for 'sem_init' in librt.
      This needs on Solaris & HP-UX.

2004-09-28  Stipe Tolj  <stolj@wapme.de>
    * doc/userguide/userguide.xml: added section for account %o escape code
      for the sms-service url translation.

2004-09-28  Stipe Tolj  <stolj@wapme.de>

2004-09-28  Stipe Tolj  <stolj@wapme.de>
    * gw/smsc/smsc_http.c: fixing 3united (formerly Xidris) HTTP interface for
      binary MT messages. We passed URL-encoced binary string, but server side 
      expected HEX encoded (2 char per byte) version.

2004-09-28  Stipe Tolj  <stolj@wapme.de>
    * gw/urltrans.c: added a fix by Alex that prevents panic'ing while msg text
      is NULL and adding '%o' as escape code for MO msgs representing the 
      msg->sms.account field. Which is interpreted as the operator ID for 
      aggregator specific MO messages. ie. Xidris HTTP SMSC module. Thanks
      to Tobias for this.

2004-09-27  Stipe Tolj  <stolj@wapme.de>
    * gw/smsc/smsc_http.c: fixed a binary MT bug (when DC_8BIT ahs been set) and
      various improvements for passing parameters to the HTTP request. Added
      credits to Tobias Weber <weber@wapme.de> who did improvements on the code.

2004-09-27 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * gw/smsc/smsc_smpp.c: fixed stupid bug that dlr lookup was
      made with source instead of destination address (in dlr
      source and destination switched).

2004-09-25 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * gwlib/gw-rwlock.c, gw/smsc/smsc_at.h: fixed compiler warnings.

2004-09-18 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>

    * gw/sms.[ch], gw/smsc/smsc_at.[ch], gw/smsc/smsc_emi.c: applied patch
      that adds usage of priority queue and priority flag in smsc_at & smsc_emi.
      This patch makes it possible to prioritize messages and to ensure that older
      messages will be sent first.
      [Msg-ID: <ch9pko$r5u$2@sea.gmane.org>].

2004-09-04  Stipe Tolj  <stolj@wapme.de>
    * doc/userguide/userguide.xml: fixing jade compiler error of Alex's 
      previous commit for priority flag.

2004-09-03  Stipe Tolj  <stolj@wapme.de>
    * gw/smsc/smsc_http.c: upgradding bruNET response parsing to comply with
      more recent interface verions (v2.0+) where bruNET delivers 'MessageId'
      in the HTTP response body.

2004-09-03 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * gw/smsc/smsc_smpp.c, gw/msg-decl.h, gw/smsbox.c: applied patch that allows
      setting of sms priority flag in smsbox and smpp module. Also fixes wrong 
      priority setting in smpp module.
    * doc/userguide/userguide.xml: describe 'priority' flag and some missing params.

2004-09-01  Stipe Tolj  <stolj@wapme.de>
    * doc/userguide/userguide.xml: moved EMI/UCP specific 'throughput' to 
      general section, since this is within the SMSCConn structure itself.
      Added 'smasi' features to the check lists.

2004-08-30 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * gwlib/gw-rwlock.[ch]: fixed includes. we don't define HAVE_CONFIG_H so
      gw-config.h should be always included.

2004-08-30 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * gw/smsc/smsc_smpp.c: added ESME dlr bit to DLR processing (some smsc's sent
      us esm_class=0x08 and it's IMO ok). 

2004-08-30 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * doc/userguide/userguide.xml: removed centrium references and changed email addr.

2004-08-28 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * gw/bb_smscconn.c, gw/msg-decl.h, gw/msg.[ch], gw/sms.h, gw/smsbox.c,
      gw/smscconn.c, gw/wapbox.c, gw/smsc/smsc_http.c, gw/smsc/smsc_soap.c,
      utils/mtbatch.c: applied patch that implements concatenation of large
      sms inside bearerbox and does care of a sending all message parts over
      one smsc link. Now we have a problem with concatenated large sms that
      bearerbox will try to load balance those over diff. smsc links and such
      messages arrive as junk (all parts of concatenated large sms must go through
      the same smsc).

2004-08-28 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * gw-config.h.in, configure.in, configure: changed 'HAVE_PTHREAD_RWLOCK_T' to
      more generic 'HAVE_PTHREAD_RWLOCK'.
    * gwlib/gw-rwlock.[ch]: added "ugly" rwlock emulation code if no pthread_rwlock
      support detected. This emulation code uses List and works in all cases where
      rwlock used in kannel.

2004-08-26  Stipe Tolj  <stolj@wapme.de>
    * gw/wap-appl.c: fixing a memory leak while not destroying a created octstr

2004-08-26  Stipe Tolj  <stolj@wapme.de>
    * gw/wml_compiler.c: fixed PANIC inside octstr_create in wml compiler with 
      certain DOCTYPE definitions. Thanks to Slava for the patch.
      [Msg-ID: <412B44E4.9080204@lmt.lv>]

2004-08-26  Stipe Tolj  <stolj@wapme.de>

      [Msg-ID: <412ADEEE.2030608@lmt.lv>]

2004-08-25 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * gwlib/semaphore.c: changed 'HAVE_SEMAPHORE_H' to 'HAVE_SEMAPHORE' and
      removed workaround for DARWIN.
    * configure, configure.in, gw-config.h.in: changed 'HAVE_SEMAPHORE_H'
      to 'HAVE_SEMAPHORE' and added configure check for working sem_init and
      friends.

2004-08-24 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * Makefile.in: remove 'gwlib/gw_uuid_types.h' by distclean too.

2004-08-23  Stipe Tolj  <stolj@wapme.de>

    * test/test_prioqueue.c: fixed compiler warning.

2004-08-20  Stipe Tolj  <stolj@wapme.de>
    * gwlib/gw-prioqueue.c: some source beautifying ;) no logic change.
    * test/test_prioqueue.c: adding Alex's simple test program for testing
      the generic priority queue he introduced to gwlib.

2004-08-19 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * gw/smsc/smsc_at.c: fixed segfault when modemtype is set to 'auto'
      or 'autodetect'. Fixed '+CPIN', some modem needs '"'.

2004-08-19 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * gwlib/gw-prioqueue.[ch]: implemented very simple priority queue ala
      Robert Sedgewick. Behavior like kannel's list.
      Thanks to 'almado.de' for the idea.

2004-08-18  Stipe Tolj  <stolj@wapme.de>

      to avoid a "not implemented" error

2004-08-12 Alexander Malysh <olek2002 at hotmail.com>
    * gwlib/utils.c: fixed warning about format attributes.

2004-08-12 Alexander Malysh <olek2002 at hotmail.com>
    * gwlib/gwthread-pthread.c: declared 'tsd_key' and 'threadtable_lock' static,
      because those are local symbols and don't exported to the world.
    * gwlib/gwthread.h: added 'gw-config.h' and 'sys/poll.h' to includes, so we can
      include 'gwlib/gwthread.h' alone.

2004-08-11  Stipe Tolj  <stolj@wapme.de>
    * various files: a generic spellchecking patch to fix mis-spelling.
      Mainly this fixes bad-english comments in source files.

      compiler format warnings.

2004-08-08 Alexander Malysh <olek2002 at hotmail.com>
    * gwlib/gw-rwlock.[ch], gw/dlr_mem.c, gw/bb_smscconn.c: got
      rid of PTHREAD_RWLOCK_INITIALIZER because it's not on opengroup
      standard (PTHREAD_RWLOCK_INITIALIZER is deleted for alignment with
      IEEE Std 1003.1j-2000).

2004-08-08  Bruno Rodrigues  <bruno.rodrigues@litux.org>

      instead of only one.
      [Msg-Id: <cek0ss$5kp$1@sea.gmane.org>].

2004-07-20 Alexander Malysh <olek2002 at hotmail.com>
    * gwlib/date.c: fixed 'date_parse_iso' and 'date_create_iso'.
      date_create_iso: 'Z' at the and means UTC time and not local time.
      date_parse_iso: never works?!
