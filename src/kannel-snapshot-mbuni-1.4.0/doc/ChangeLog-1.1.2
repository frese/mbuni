2001-02-26  Richard Braakman <dark@wapit.com>

	* Making release 1.1.2.

2001-02-23  Peter Grönholm  <peter@wapit.com>

        * userguide: Wrote section "Setting up a dial-up line"

2001-02-21  Richard Braakman  <dark@wapit.com>

	* gw/wap-appl.c: Suppress server-generated error pages if they
	are in a format (i.e. text/html) that the client does not accept.

2001-02-21  Richard Braakman  <dark@wapit.com>

	* gw/wap-appl.c: When suppressing an HTTP result body because it is
	too long for the client, also adjust the Content-Length header.

2001-02-21  Tuomas Luttinen  <tuo@wapit.com>

	* gw/wml_compiler.c (set_charset): The function uses now 
	charset_to_utf8 function to convert the WML document into the 
	UTF-8 charset before feeding it to the libxml parser.

	* gwlib/charset.[ch]: Added the functions charset_to_utf8 and 
	charset_from_utf8. These are frontend for the libxml character set
	converion funtions.

2001-02-20  Peter Grönholm  <peter@wapit.com>

	* userguide: Updated section "Installing Kannel from RPM packages"

2001-02-20  Richard Braakman  <dark@wapit.com>

	* userguide: Explained more about syslog-level.

2001-02-16  Richard Braakman  <dark@wapit.com>

	* gw/smsbox.c: Fix a potential buffer overflow in sms_split(),
	by removing the partlist array and using List directly.

	* gw/urltrans.c: Fix memory leak: destroy_onetrans also destroys
	"header" and "footer".

	* gw/urltrans.c: Warn if a service configures prefix or suffix
	when they will not be used.

	* userguide: Describe when prefix and suffix are used.

	* userguide: Improve description of "omit-empty".  (Suggested
	by Gildas Perrot.)

2001-02-16  Richard Braakman  <dark@wapit.com>

	* gw/bb_smscconn.c, gw/urltrans.c: Deal with cfg_get_multi_group()
	possibly being NULL.

	* gw/bb_smscconn_p.h: Add #include "smscconn.h" so that it doesn't
	depend on the caller having included that file already.

2001-02-15  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

	* gw/smpp_pdu.def, gw/smsc_smpp.c: Implemented the enquire_link
	PDU and the corresponding enquire_link_resp PDU. This should keep
	Kannel connected to an SMPP SMS center even when the connection
	is otherwise idle.
	
	* test/drive_smpp.c: Cleaned up shutdown.

2001-02-15  Tuomas Luttinen  <tuo@wapit.com>

	* gw/wml_compiler.c (set_charset): bug reported by Aymerick Jéhanne
	fixed so no more 2*encoding in the XML-header.

2001-02-15  Richard Braakman  <dark@wapit.com>

	* gw/smsc_at.c: Corrected timestamp calculation.  mktime()
	uses local time, and it got a GMT time.  Converted to use
	date_convert_universal() from gwlib/date.c instead.
	(There is no function in the C library for this task.)
	It probably still doesn't work for negative timezones,
	I'll have to check the specs for that.

	* gwlib/date.[ch]: Make date_convert_universal() a public
	function.

2001-02-14  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

	* gwlib/octstr.[ch]: Changed the octstr_create_urlcoded to be
	similar in name and usage to octstr_url_decode.
	
	* gw/bb_store.c, gw/smsc_fake.c, gw/urltrans.c: Changed the
	places where the function is called.

2001-02-14  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

	* gw/urltrans.c, doc/userguide/userguide.xml: Restored the
	meaning of %a in sms-service, implemented and documented %b to
	support binary data.

2001-02-14  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

	* gw/smsbox.c, doc/userguide/userguide.xml: Implemented
	X-Kannel-UDH header in responses to keyword fetches.

2001-02-13  Uoti Urpala  <uau@wapit.com>

	* gw/smsc.c: Fixed octstr_get_cstr(NULL) when username, password
	or allow_ip wasn't specified in emi_ip smsc group. This bug
	probably appeared when smsc.c was converted to use cfg.c.

2001-02-13  Richard Braakman  <dark@wapit.com>

	* gw/wml_definitions.h: Applied patch from Aymerick Jéhanne
	to correct encodings for "ordered true" and "ordered false".

2001-02-12  Kalle Marjola  <rpr@wapit.com>

	* gw/bb_smscconn.c, gw/bb_boxc.c, gw/bearerbox.h: Modified so that
	SMS messages from smsbox are directly put into corresponding SMS
	centers, or if not able, either rejected (i.e. discarded right
	now) or put to outgoing_sms queue which acts like delayed list

	* gw/bb_smscconn_cb.h: added new callback, smscconn_connected,
	which is called when status changes to ACTIVE, and makes bearerbox
	trying to empty outgoing_sms queue

	* gw/smsc_wrapper.c, gw/smsc_fake.c: modified to call that new
	callback

2001-02-12  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

	* Makefile.in: Moved -I. to before other -I options (before
	@CFLAGS@) so that Kannel's config.h is found before any config.h
	that might be a system header file.

2001-02-12  Kalle Marjola  <rpr@wapit.com>

	* gw/bb_store.c: Ooops, forgot to add earlier. Anyway, now uses
	straight octstr handling instead of using octstr_split and thus
	does not need so much memory while unpacking the store-file

2001-02-12  Kalle Marjola  <rpr@wapit.com>

	* gw/bb_boxc.c: removed heartbeat message kludge as it caused
	other problems, had to think this more...

	* gw/bb_http.c: removed debug information of HTTP query result
	because it caused ankward output 

	* gw/bb_store.c: Added. Handles SMS store 

	* gw/msg-decl.h, gw/msg.h: added new 'ack' message type and new 
	fields to sms. Name of these can change later.

	* gw/bb_boxc.c, gw/bb_smscconn.c, gw/bearerbox.c, gw/smsbox.c: 
	implemented first version of SMS storing/retrieval system. 
	Consumes lots of memory when starting up, so does not work
	well with checking malloc, will fix that today.

	* gw/*kannel.conf: added (commented-out) store-file row

2001-02-10  Uoti Urpala  <uau@wapit.com>

	* gw/smsbox.c: Fixed bugs in smsbox_req_sendota(), added 'from'
	CGI variable to sendota requests.

	* gwlib/cfg.def: Added missing 'speed' variable to otaconfig
	group.

	* doc/userguide/userguide.xml: Documented the added 'from'
	variable. 'speed' was also missing from the documentation.

	* gw/smsc_fake.c: Implemented SMSCCONN_FAILED_TEMPORARILY
	(probably doesn't make much difference in practice).

	* gwlib/octstr.c: Fixed memory leak in octstr_append_from_hex().

2001-02-08  Richard Braakman  <dark@wapit.com>

	* Applied Stipe Tolj's patch to cfg.def and userguide, to
	fix OTA configuration parsing.

2001-02-07  Kalle Marjola  <rpr@wapit.com>

	* gw/bb_boxc.c: kludged to use internal heartbeat to wakeup sender
	from consume if other end closes the connection

	* gw/bb_smscconn.c: modified failed routing access log output

	* utils/accesslog_parser.pl: added failed routing to final output,
	and change all keywords to lowercase

2001-02-07  Kalle Marjola  <rpr@wapit.com>

	* utils/accesslog_parser.pl: added simple perl script to read
	(SMS) access log and print statistics out of it, based on hours.
	Uses the new format printed out by bb_smscconn.c

2001-02-07  Kalle Marjola  <rpr@wapit.com>

	* gw/bearerbox.c: Bugfix. Fixed memory leak caused by access log /
	new config

	* doc/userguide/userguide.xml: made it clearer that sms-service is
	selected by keyword and number of parameters

	* gw/bb_smscconn.c: Bugfix: fixed access log to use Octstring return value

	* gw/bb_smscconn.c: Compatibility breaker: modified access log
	output
	
2001-02-07  Yann Muller  <ymuller@3glab.com>

	* gw/smsc_at.c: added support for Ericsson GSM modems (patch from
	Chris Blown).

2001-02-06  Uoti Urpala  <uau@wapit.com>

	* gw/urltrans.c: Changed the %a URL parameter to mean the original
	message as-is, to allow binary data. Previously consecutive
	whitespace characters were changed into one space. Note that %r
	was NOT changed, maybe it should work similarly?

2001-02-06  Kalle Marjola  <rpr@wapit.com>

	* gw/bb_smscconn_cb.h: added new failed sending status,
	SMSCCONN_FAILED_TEMPORARILY, which should be called if connection
	to SMS center is lost temporarily

	* gw/bb_smscconn.c: added handling for new status

	* gw/smscconn_p.h: added comments of the new status
	
	* gw/smsc_wrapper.c: added that when reconnect is started, message
	queue is emptied from messages with status
	SMSCCONN_FAILED_TEMPORARILY
	

2001-02-06  Peter Grönholm  <peter@wapit.com>

	* utils/kannel-stable-rh6x.spec: Added rpm spec file for Kannel
	stable releases.

	* utils/kannel-stable-rh7.spec: Added rpm spec file for Kannel
	stable releases.

2001-02-06  Uoti Urpala  <uau@wapit.com>

	* gw/smsbox.c: Rewrote message-splitting functions because they
	had lots and lots of bugs. Basically they didn't work if
	split-chars, split-suffix or concatenation was defined.

2001-02-05  Richard Braakman  <dark@wapit.com>

	* gwlib/octstr.c: Fixed off-by-one error in octstr_case_search(),
	reported by Vjacheslav Chekushin.

2001-02-04  Richard Braakman  <dark@wapit.com>

	* wmlscript/wsasm.c: Avoid generating 0-length functions,
	because not all clients can handle them.

	* gw/wap-appl.c: If the response body does not fit in the
	client SDU size, generate status code 502 ("Bad Gateway")
	instead of 413 ("Request Entity Too Large").  413 is definitely
	the wrong code because it refers to the request, not the
	response.  502 means the gateway received an invalid response
	from the server, which is pretty close.
        Also, do not touch the status code at all if it already indicates
	an error.  The upstream error is more interesting to the user
	than knowing that the error page didn't fit.

	* gwlib/http.[ch]: Add http_status_class() function to
	distinguish success codes (2xx) from error codes.

2001-02-02  Tuomas Luttinen  <tuo@wapit.com>

	* test/decompile.[ch]: Applied the patch by Neil Hunter that 
	implements the codepage switch, changes the indent size to a #define
	and adds basic support for different DTDs.

	* gw/utf8map_iso8859-7.h, gw/utf8map_win1251.h, gw/utf8map_win1257.h,
	gw/utf8map_koi8r.h, gw/utf8map_win1253.h: removed as obsolete.

	* gw/wml_compiler.c: Patch by Vjacheslav Chekushin applied. The
	patch makes the libxml aware of some aliases for different 
	character_sets, so these can be used in the WML content with the 
	libxml.
	Some other modifications due modifications in the wml_definitions.h.

	* gw/wml_definitions.h: Patch by Vjacheslav Chekushin applied. The 
	patch removes the use of the utf8map in the character_sets[].
	Also utf8map removed from the character_sets[].

2001-02-02  Tuomas Luttinen  <tuo@wapit.com>

	* gw/wml_compiler.c (string_table_collect_strings): Removed the 
	if (strlen(node->content) > WBXML_STRING_TABLE_MIN) -line that 
	won't work with XML_USE_BUFFER_CONTENT.

2001-02-02  Richard Braakman  <dark@wapit.com>

	* Added gwmem_type() function that returns the name of the 
	malloc wrapper used.

	* gw/shared.c: Report gwmem_type in the version string.

2001-02-01  Richard Braakman  <dark@wapit.com>

	* Updated doc/release.txt to better reflect actual procedure.
	Only covers development releases for now.
