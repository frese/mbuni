      want to pass this to octstr_split_words().

      Couldn't this be avoided by dealing with a NULL'ed octstr inside
      octstr_split_words() itself?!
    * gw/bboxc.c: fixed the unnecessary mutex locking in case we deal
      with a wapbox connection. Thanks Robert for pointing this out.
    * gwlib/cfg.def, gw/wap_push_ppg_pushuser.c: added smsc-id value handling
      for the 'wap-push-user' group. The transportation of the value up to the
      bearerbox sending routine has to be implemented yet.
